### Hi, I'm Juan 🌱
## A full-stack web developer in Córdoba, Argentina 🇦🇷

My path in web development began in 2021, and since then I have trained in different areas of this incredible world.

I'm always learning new tools and technologies, because it is never enough! 🤓😅 I really enjoy working in teams and learning from my colleagues.

Currently I lean more towards backend development, although I also develop frontend from time to time
